            neighborhoods. Within the community, we have the activism, culture,
            cuisine, and the intellect. From the Shape Center, the Eldorado
            Ballroom, Frenchy’s, Texas Southern University, it’s all here.
            Growing up in a community like this amplifies a kind of Black pride
            that was important for me to carry along on my journey to another
            great American neighborhood, Harlem. I had the feeling that
            everything I’d ever need was within 77004.</em

            Within Third Ward is also the barrier of the bayou. There is
            something about having a “river” swell and recede that though it is
            not as historic as the Mississippi River, that relationship is firm
            in the minds of every resident during a storm. Most of all, I think
            Third Ward feels so special because it is filled with families that
            have been there for generations. I have watched gentrification sink
            its teeth into Third Ward, but we still hold our truths for the
            neighborhood to keep the bones strong.</em

            the shotgun houses to the railroad and bike path that courses
            through it. It is also the wild dogs on the street, and the fried
            fish cooked on the corner. Third Ward is a village. I think enough
            of life is heard on these streets that easily translates into the
            music. From the howl of the train whistle to the barking dog, the
            sound of the neighborhood is an orchestra unto itself. It’s still a
            country part of a metropolis.”</em

          <strong>What are the blues?</strong> A question as old as the genre
          itself, the blues are hard to pinpoint. As Grammy-award winning
          recording artist Van Hunt told me, “You could ask me this question
          every day and every day I’d have a different answer; because the blues
          are exactly what you need — when you need it.” <br /><br />
          At the start of this project, I was on a quest to draw a linear
          connection to seven different guitarists who were born, raised, or
          lived in my native Third Ward, Houston, Texas: Sam “Lightnin’ Hopkins,
          Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown, Albert Collins, Johnny “Guitar” Watson,
          Joe “Guitar” Hughes, Johnny Clyde Copeland, and Marion “Little Joe”
          Washington. These figures were each uniquely talented, troubled,
          feared, and revered. The similarities among them could not simply be
          boiled down to a single musical note, a guitar model, or the subject
          matter of their lyrical compositions. They all strove to develop a
          unique voice through their instrument. The competition was fierce, and
          while influences were inescapable, they each understood that you
          couldn’t be a carbon copy of the next guy.
          <br /><br />
          Certainly, at times there was a sense of comradery among the
          collective throughout their careers, but no one willingly accepted a
          backseat.

          <br /><br />
          Third Ward is not Houston’s oldest black community, but by the early
          20th century it was the largest. The neighborhood featured a prominent
          business district centered on Dowling Street (now Emancipation
          Avenue). By the 1950’s, the Third Ward was known for live music.
          Houston’s lack of zoning regulations fed this eclectic music scene. In
          the neighborhood, bungalow houses or local shops bought cases of beer,
          put them on ice, and operated as an evening juke joint. Lifelong Third
          Ward resident Mary Bennett recalls, “Shady’s Playhouse. That’s where
          they would all go play. They had a band just about every night.” Young
          musicians in the neighborhood grew up in casual joints like Shady’s
          Playhouse, Club Ebony, or Club Savoy, and often ended up playing
          renowned upscale venues like the El Dorado Ballroom.
          <br /><br />
          By the time Third Ward had developed a robust live music culture, one
          man was already a local legend: Sam “Lightnin’” Hopkins. Born March
          15, 1912, in Centerville, Texas, Lightnin’ Hopkins was the patriarch
          of the blues guitar in Third Ward. Hopkins first moved to Houston in
          the late 1930’s and made Houston his permanent home in 1946. Lightnin’
          carried his Texas countryside ties to his new urban stomping ground.
          He used this charming and rugged rural upbringing, endearing himself
          to Houston until his death in 1982. Local accounts of Hopkins riding
          the Houston city bus pre- desegregation and playing impromptu concerts
          for riders fueled his legendary status. Few people were as beloved as
          Lightnin’ in Third Ward. Houston blues historian Roger Wood said, “His
          strong personality and his presence in the community created this kind
          of potent mythos about what a bluesman was”. Lightnin’ Hopkins’
          greatest influence on future Third Ward guitarists set the standard
          for what a bluesman was supposed to be.

          <br /><br />
          Despite his country roots, Lightnin’ did not have the appearance of a
          Centerville-born sharecropper. Hopkins sported beautiful gold teeth,
          jet black sunglasses, and a fedora perfectly cocked to the side. This
          combination of genial countryman mixed with urban cool prevailed in
          many of his recordings and performances. Lightnin’ rarely performed
          the same song twice in the same way – often improvising lyrics as the
          song went on. As jazz pianist and educator Jason Moran put it, “Texas
          blues settles in. Lightnin’ settles into his stories in a way that
          says “I ain’t leavin’.”
          <br /><br />

          Lightnin’s iconic status nationally and in the Third Ward grew due to
          the blues-folk revival of the 1950’s and 1960’s. Suddenly, Lightnin’
          became an everyday fixture in the neighborhood, shooting dice in the
          alley one day, and playing major gigs in Europe or Japan the next.
          Roger Wood believes, “That’s a big part of Lightnin’s influence. He
          showed these guys that that the old roots still had juice and there
          was something still worth chewing on there.” Despite Lightnin’s career
          renaissance, his old school style of fingerpicking took a backseat to
          the newer sophisticated styles of jazz, R&B, and rock & roll music.
          Ultimately, Lightnin’ represented the country days. Young musicians
          growing up in Houston couldn’t understand much of the life that was
          prevalent in Hopkins’ music. Wood continued, “Even when he’s playing
          electric guitar, he’s still got something that you can’t just say it
          and make it happen. It’s got to be real. He’s got the connection to
          the battle days, the country days, the sharecropping days and what
          preceded that.”

          <br /><br />

          Younger local musicians gravitated to the cool, elegant, progressive
          sound of T-Bone Walker. Lightnin’ died in 1982 in Houston and remains
          one of the most celebrated bluesmen of all time.

        In 1949, Fifth Ward’s Don Robey founded Peacock Records, one of the most prominent recording labels for southern Black artists. Many top recording acts of the time came
to Houston to record at Peacock’s studios, and often perform at local venues. The most influential blues guitarists during this era were Aaron Thibeaux “T-Bone” Walker
and Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown. Born in Linden, Texas in 1910, T-Bone quickly became a legendary figure
in the Texas
music scene. The new large, urban population had a preexisting cultural tradition in blues, and then suddenly the immediate modern influence of the recordings and appearances
of T-Bone. This allowed young artists to hear the blues in a different
voice challenging the existing music.
        <br /><br />
        While T-Bone Walker had gained national fame for his clean, jazzy style,
another Houston-based guitarist became a major influence on the young musicians in Third Ward: Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown. According to Roger Wood, “The Houston Third Ward guitar sound is simultaneously influenced by T-Bone Walker but pulled back by Gatemouth to put some dirt in the hair wax so to speak.” Like most other guitar players at the time, Gatemouth followed T-Bone Walker, but created his own sound to 
compliment that influence. Gatemouth’s style consisted of fluid single note runs punctuated with forceful chords that sounded like a full horn section, a style he reportedly landed on when he couldn’t afford to tour with horns. Longtime Houston harmonica player Sonny Boy Terry recalls, “Gatemouth could play orchestral jazz and sound like a saxophone on that guitar.”

        <br /><br />
        Younger musicians had to make a choice: sound like T-Bone or Gatemouth. These artists found their own voices with the influences of their predecessors, spawning a unique blues guitar
sound, and building
one of the most
talented collectives
of blues guitarists
ever.
        <br /><br />

        Jason Moran explained, “In
Texas, we aren’t beholden to one music tradition, so we pull sounds together. Other cities with very hard tried and true sonic histories
strive hard to preserve them. Texas blues says, ‘It’s all ours, ain’t it?”

   Simply existing in the Third Ward with a guitar and some influences didn’t guarantee fortune or notoriety. Given the hotbed
of talent, guitarists needed a Lightnin’-
like persona and a distinctive style, both immediately recognizable and difficult
to mimic. This vibrant local scene called musicians to innovate and not just perform based on tradition. This constantly fueled creativity and expression and fed the general health of the music.
  

   <br /><br />
   While Albert Collins attended Jack Yates High School in Third Ward, he began playing with Gatemouth. Famously known as “The Iceman” and “The Master of the Telecaster”, Collins got his first band together at 18, the Rhythm Rockers, which included a young Johnny Clyde Copeland. Collins gained national exposure in the early-1960’s when
he released his instrumental hit “Frosty”.
The unique way Collins attacked the strings
became known
as “ice picking”, mimicked by
many but nearly impossible to duplicate. According to Roger Wood, “No one could walk into a gig and pick up Albert’s guitar and play it.”
   <br /><br />

   Like many Third Ward guitarists Collins did not use a plectrum, creating
a stinging, piercing sound that became synonymous with Collins throughout his career. While “Frosty” was
Collins’ most famous song, his 1958 single “Collins Shuffle” may have had the biggest impact. Jimi Hendrix was such a big fan of Collins that the opening to Hendrix’s 1968 classic “Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)” is lifted directly from “Collins Shuffle”. Collins and Hendrix met while Hendrix was the backing guitarist for Little Richard. In a 1968 interview, Hendrix declared his love
for “The Iceman” saying, “There’s one cat I’m still trying to get across to people. He is really good, one of the best guitarists in the world.” Hendrix also reimagined Collins’ tune “Thaw Out” on his well-known outtake “Drivin’ South”. Like Collins’ cousin Lightnin’ Hopkins, Albert Collins somehow found his own voice, influenced by but apart from T-Bone, Gatemouth, B.B. King or others that came before. 

   <br /><br />

   Just as Gatemouth got his start with T-Bone Walker, and Collins first began playing with Gatemouth, Johnny “Guitar” Watson cut his teeth by playing with Albert Collins as a child prodigy. Watson’s daughter Virginia said, “You know, Collins and all those guys used to sneak dad out of the house. He was so gifted from the day he was born, and being
gifted like that, you
know, at 8 or 9 years
old you’re inside the
club at one o’clock
in the morning.
Albert and them
would pick him up
out the backyard
and would steal my
great grandfather’s
church guitar and
throw it right over
the fence.”

 Watson moved from Third Ward to Los Angeles at
15 years old, but
always remained
connected to the
city of Houston.
Virginia recalled “Dad loved LA, but he always considered Houston his home.” Johnny “Guitar” Watson confirms this on the 1976 live recording of “I Need It” recorded
at Oncle Pö’s Carnegie Hall in Hamburg, saying “For the benefit of those of you who don’t know me, my name is Johnny “Guitar” Watson, yours truly. I was born in Houston, Texas – and I’d like to play a little Texas guitar for you now.” Separately, on his 1979 album What The Hell Is This? Watson punctuates “I Don’t Want to Be President” by exclaiming “If I run for mayor of my hometown, I want all of y’all to vote for me. Wouldn’t that be something? Johnny “Guitar” Watson the mayor of Houston!”

<br><br>
Arguably the most famous of all the Third Ward bluesman, Watson changed
his musical styles many times. He began on piano as Young John Watson, personifying a smooth southern gentleman. By the mid- 1950’s, as blues morphed into rock & roll, Watson made the transition seamlessly, recording tracks like 1957’s “Gangster of Love” and 1954’s “Space Guitar” – the latter possibly being the first ever record to utilize electric guitar feedback and reverb, well over
a decade before
Jimi Hendrix and others popularized the technique.
Once Black music shifted to the sounds of funk, Johnny “Guitar” Watson found his sweet
spot as a recording artist and performer. With his classic albums in the 1970’s Ain’t That A Bitch (1976) and his most successful record
A Real Mother
For Ya (1977), Watson flourished on the U.S. charts and found a new
international audience that would stay with him until he died in 1996.

<br><br>
Watson’s prowess as a guitarist and musical genius has influenced key music figures including D’Angelo, Snoop Dogg, George Duke, Jimi Hendrix, Pearl Jam, Etta James, Prince, Lou Rawls, Sly Stone, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Frank Zappa, and many others. DC funk legend and “The Godfather of Go-Go” Chuck Brown claimed that his biggest inspiration musically and stylistically was Johnny “Guitar” Watson. Watson inspired blues, rock & roll, funk, and hip-hop artists. His song “Telephone Bill”, released in 1980 on his record Love Jones is an early hiphop record, with Watson rapping about his extensive use of his house phone running up his phone bill. Hip-Hop artists Dr. Dre, Devin The Dude, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Notorious B.I.G., Redman, Talib Kweli, and UGK, among others, all
sampled Watson.

<br><br>
One of Watson’s closest musical friends from Houston was Joe Hughes. Born in Houston’s Fourth Ward, Hughes lived nearly his entire adult life in Third Ward. Hughes added “Guitar” to his stage name in honor
of his idol and close friend, Johnny “Guitar” Watson. Longtime Hughes collaborator Sonny Boy Terry recalls, “He told everybody this, he became Joe “Guitar” Hughes because of Johnny Watson.”
<br><br>
Hughes confirmed his affection for Watson in a conversation with Roger Wood. He recounted the 1996 Juneteenth Blues Festival at Houston’s Miller Outdoor Theatre. Wood recalled, “Joe Hughes comes out and he’s dour and I said “Oh, this doesn’t look good.” He comes out and starts playing a
song I didn’t recognize. He played another song I did not recognize. He played another song and I recognized it, but I couldn’t place it. Then he went to the mic for the first time and says, “Folks we just found
out Johnny Watson died and we’re playing
a tribute to him tonight.” He did his whole 50-minute set just one Watson song after another. It was obvious to anyone there that whoever this Watson guy was he was huge to Joe Hughes.”

<br><br>
In 1952 Hughes founded the Dukes
of Rhythm with best friend Johnny Clyde Copeland and Herbert Henderson, later adding James Johnson, and through the mid- 1950s regularly played Galveston
venues. From 1958 through 1963 Hughes found most of his work in the Third Ward, leading his own band seven nights a week at Shady’s Playhouse.
<br><br>

Hughes was known for his clean, jazzy style of play using his 335 Gibson, very similar to T-Bone Walker. Unlike some of the other Third Ward guitarists, Joe “Guitar” Hughes’ career was mostly in Houston. Hughes always saw Houston as his home, and even when his best friend and frequent musical partner Johnny Copeland enticed him with offers to move to New York to play for “some real money”, Hughes couldn’t bring himself to leave the city he loved.

The bond between Hughes and Copeland lasted nearly their entire lives, and they held each other in high regard. Harmonica player Sonny Boy Terry remembers, “When you were around JC’s
band members, all
the guys in Johnny’s
band were supposed
to treat Joe Hughes
with the equal
respect as Johnny
and it was likewise
the other way
around.”

<br><br>
While Hughes and Copeland
were very tight
personally, musically,
they both followed
the golden rule
of Third Ward blues
guitar: find your
own style
and stick to it.
Johnny Copeland
took a rawer single
line attack, while
Joe Hughes played
a funky-fingers
style. Sonny Boy
Terry says, “Joe
sounded really
clean, and he had
a sophisticated sound like T-Bone Walker.” Johnny Copeland was well known as a songwriter, not just a performer of blues standards, and won a Grammy award with Albert Collins and Robert Cray for their 1985 album Showdown!
<br><br>

Copeland died in 1997 in New York, and Hughes remained in Houston until his death in 2003.

            his Third Ward contemporaries,
            but his legend became cemented
            by the mid-2000’s throughout Houston. As
            Third Ward-born rapper Fat Tony says, “Little Joe Washington, he was a big part of that local music scene that is associated with Montrose, midtown and downtown. He had
            a residency gig at Boondocks which was the hipster dive bar in Montrose, and he had a presence with the Continental Club audience in midtown, which
            is more of that
            old school blues, country, Americana type of crowd, an
            older crowd. It was interesting that Little Joe Washington had a foot in both of those worlds and was embraced by both of those worlds locally.”
            <br /><br />

            Little Joe got his nickname by imitating his childhood friend Joe “Guitar” Hughes during breaks on Hughes’ gigs. Like most of the other guitarists, Little Joe was a multi- instrumentalist playing any instrument in front of him. A close friend to Washington, Roger Wood recalled a time when he asked Little Joe, “Joe how are you doing that?” as he smoothly improvised with different bands. Washington replied, “Man I don’t know how I do it, but if I can hum something, I can play it on any instrument.” Washington also played trumpet, keyboards, piano, and trombone.

            Following a brief apprenticeship in
Houston clubs, Little Joe toured with Rosco Gordon’s road band. Later, with Cecil Harvey’s group, he traveled west playing from Texas to Nevada. Around the age of
20 he settled, if that’s the word for Little Joe’s lifestyle, in El Paso, where he played the rowdy border town circuit, including a stint at the Lobby Bar in Juarez, Mexico. There he met the group The Champs, most famous for “Tequila,” who took him to California in 1961 to record on the Donna label. While there Washington recorded the original versions of “A Hard Way Four” and “The Last Tear”. In 1963 Little Joe returned to Los Angeles, where he recorded for Federal Records, releasing singles “Someone Loves Me,” “I Feel All Right,” and the awesomely titled “Bossa Nova and Grits”.
<br><br>
Washington was known for his energetic and sometimes erratic stage presence. He played the guitar behind his back, with
his crotch, with his teeth, and standing on
his head, a trick Johnny “Guitar” Watson claimed to popularize.
<br><br>
By the early 2000’s Little Joe reached
a resurgence. Austin-based record producer and Founder of Dialtone Records Eddie Stout recorded Little Joe’s 2005 standout record Houston Guitar Blues. In our phone conversation Stout said, “When he did
play, it was incredible. You’d see shades
of Gatemouth Brown, you’d see shades of Johnny “Guitar” Watson, you’d hear some Albert Collins in there, you’d hear Joe Hughes in there.” When asked what kind of guitar Little Joe favored, Stout replied, “His favorite guitar was somebody else’s. But he did like light strings and a Telecaster or a Strat.”
<br><br>
Despite Little Joe’s lifestyle that perhaps kept him from being as well-known as his contemporaries, Eddie Stout believes Little Joe was just as talented. Stout said, “Little Joe, he was the best gunslinger out of Houston, and he knew it.” Johnny Copeland, just two years older than his lifelong friend, acknowledged Washington’s influence in
an interview with Houston Press reporter
Jim Sherman in 1996, “My music, Albert Collins’ music, Joe Hughes’ music—when you listen to any of that, you’ll hear some Little Joe.” Legend has it that in 1958 Joe “Guitar” Hughes had a studio session booked at Gold Star Studios but couldn’t make the session due to a gig. Albert Collins was notified
about the cancellation and gladly accepted the vacancy. That session produced Collins’ classic single “The Freeze,” with a distinctive opening lick from none other than a 19-year- old Little Joe Washington.
<br><br>
Even when Little Joe’s best playing days were behind him, he built a cast of supporting friends and fans who would become family, and they cared for him until he died in 2014. Speaking on Washington’s impact in the Third Ward, Roger Wood said, “In a minor way, Little Joe Washington was like Lightnin’ in that people who were blues fans in the music scene in Third Ward, they knew who Little Joe was. He had a presence that made Third Ward feel like a small village in the sense that everyone knew him. It hit me hard when Little Joe died. There’s a sound that Little Joe was doing that I heard Joe Hughes doing and I hear it on Johnny Watson records and now I can’t go anywhere and hear that sound again.”

   EVERLASTING LEGACY

    By the late 1980’s blues music had taken a back seat to hip-hop and a more modern R&B sound. Still, these seven bluesmen left a tremendous legacy on the Third Ward, the city of Houston, and the music community at large. It’s virtually impossible to capture Albert Collins’ long term influence on
    future stars like Jimi Hendrix and how that trickled down into other musicians. Johnny Copeland’s travels to Africa in 1986 made him one of the first American bluesmen to visit the continent and record material, bringing
    a new global perspective, and encouraging others to explore new concepts. Johnny “Guitar” Watson singlehandedly introduced distortion and reverb on electric guitar more than a decade before rock & roll stars of the 1960’s. Little Joe Washington kept the blues alive for Houstonians born into the hip-hop era and inspired them with showmanship from another planet.
    <br><br>
    Regardless of the number of records sold, the amount of mainstream success, the fame, fortune, or lack thereof, Third Ward, Houston produced the greatest collective of blues guitarists that ever lived.
