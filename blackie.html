        INTERVIEW BY FAT TONY AND MATTHEW RAMIREZ<br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </div>

      <p class="p-10 max-w-4xl"><!-- I don't know why i can't decrease padding to 18 here -->
        B L A C K I E... All Caps, With Spaces is the most inspiring musician I
        ever befriended. The noise artist born Michael Jordan LaCour, is from
        LaPorte, Texas. He's been on my radar since 2007; we performed on the
        same bill at an art show in a warehouse. The warehouse was Houston
        artist Robert Hodge's gallery, and Chanelle Frazier set up the show.
        From the moment I saw B L A C K I E climb a stack of speakers he brought
        just for his set and rap/shout his lungs out in the dimly lit space, I
        fell in love. His beats boomed like Three 6 Mafia but much more
        menacing. When I bought his CD and read the lyric sheet, it revealed an
        artist as undoubtedly concerned with Weltschmerz as they were with their
        feelings. In my mind, his sound is equally indebted to Southern rap
        music, noise, and the kind of emo/hardcore music that's more Rites of
        Spring than Fall Out Boy. From that day forward, we became friends,
        collaborating from time to time, discussing the punk and rap songs we
        love, and dreaming about where our music can go next.

        In Michael's household, the word “blackie” was defamatory, a somewhat
        toned-down replacement for the n-word, but he only heard it used amongst
        family members. After being called “blackie” in a purposely derogatory
        way outside of the home, he found the true meaning. In early 2020, he
        began to perform under his real name, but it didn't stick. He admittedly
        felt on the fence about a name change and didn't correct promoters when
        they still listed him as "B L A C K I E." He told me, "the same force
        that inspired me to change my name was the same force that inspired me
        to stack speakers up. When you get an idea like that, you don't even
        question it. Something else must've implanted that thought in me, so I'm
        going to go with it. It's the same as writing music." When divinity
        speaks, Mr. LaCour listens.

      <p class="px-10 pt-3 pb-10 max-w-4xl">
        I opened for B L A C K I E in 2011 on my first tour as he promoted his
        album, True Spirit and Not Giving a Fuck. That album title perfectly
        sums up who he is; an artist with earnestness in every segment of his
        music. Here are his thoughts on each record in his catalog.

        Fat Tony: Were you born and raised in LaPorte? How did you start playing
        music?<br /><br />
        B L A C K I E: Yeah, I always pretty much lived in La Porte. I lived in
        Denton and Austin when I was older but still a teenager. The rest of my
        family is in Louisiana. I got a trumpet in 6th grade, but I switched
        over to saxophone.<br /><br />
        FT: Were you playing in the school marching band?<br /><br />
        B: Yeah, pretty much working in that direction. The marching band starts
        in 9th grade here.<br /><br />
        FT: Were you making music outside of school?<br /><br />
        B: Yeah, I was. I was experimenting with tape decks. I was super into
        hip hop. I was trying to make beats, but I had no clue what any of the
        equipment I needed was or how any of it was being created. I
        accidentally sort of received a bass guitar for Christmas. I think all
        of that was happening from 7th-8th grade.<br /><br />
        FT: How was the bass gift an accident?<br /><br />
        B: This older kid at the cafeteria lunch line was asking everyone what
        they wanted for Christmas. The boy next to me said he asked his dad for
        a bass guitar. I was always quiet. I just repeated what the kid next to
        me said. I didn't even mean it. I never thought about it before that
        day.<br /><br />
        FT: Your subconscious knew you needed another instrument<br /><br />
        B: Haha<br /><br />
        FT: Many say they're writing their debut record their whole life until
        it comes out. Was this EP comprised of songs you've worked on for years?
        Where were you in life when you released this EP? What was on your
        mind?<br /><br />
        Matthew Ramirez: Was the bass guitar your way into figuring out writing
        and recording music? Did that inspire you for the first EP?<br /><br />

        <!-- start second column -->
        B: Yes and no. By that point, I had accumulated more equipment. I was
        playing in a hardcore band. I had been working on a much longer
        recording. I was totally obsessed with making beats. When the hardcore
        band stopped, I just decided to really do my own thing. The first EP
        came together quickly, but it was much different than the longer
        recording I had put together. I was cutting yards that summer. I think
        that super intense lawnmower noise definitely influenced the EP more
        than anything. I couldn't rap in the house. I used to have to spit my
        rhymes while I cut the grass.<br /><br />
        FT: How old were you at this time?<br /><br />
        B: 16 or 17, then.<br /><br />
        FT: What equipment were you using at this point?<br /><br />
        B: A little microcassette recorder for vocals and beat-making software
        these younger skateboarder kids burnt on a CD. I think I had started
        building some larger speakers cabs and buying old guitar heads off the
        internet.<br /><br />
        FT: Were you performing live at this point too?<br /><br />
        B: Just in the hardcore band. I tried rapping live once, but I didn't
        really have the nerves yet to really do it.<br /><br />
        MR: How did you learn how to build speaker cabs and stuff? Did that
        inspire you to bring your own PAs to your shows?<br /><br />
        B: My dad had shown me how to do it. He was in a band in Louisiana in
        the 60s. They would build their own PA systems. Yeah, I was coming from
        hearing a hardcore band practice in a garage, and I just really needed
        that level of sound behind me. I liked that feeling of your ears ringing
        nonstop and your whole body is being tired and sore.<br /><br />
        FT: What happened between the EP in 2005 and your next release,
        Wilderness of North America, in 2008? That album was my introduction to
        your music. What was on your mind while making the next album?<br /><br />
        B: Many things had changed. My dad died. I left college. I wasn't a
        teenager anymore, and there weren't any more bands to be in at that
        time. I had continuously been stacking away beats. I had to stop naming
        them and start numbering them inside of alphabetical folders, but even
        that started piling up. I met this band Cop Warmth and tried to join
        them on bass. I showed them what I was doing with the beats. They
        flipped out. They really pushed me to finish the record.<br /><br />

        MR: Did something change in you that made you more confident in rapping
        live? Was it related to your love for putting together your own gear and
        being inspired that way?<br /><br />
        B: Yeah, I think by 2008, I had a crazy amp wall. Also, just the
        sequence of life events really opened my mind. My thought process was
        like, "there's no going back. Cop Warmth were wild as hell too. A lot of
        those shows in those years were with Cop Warmth.<br /><br />
        MR: I remember seeing them at the first FPSF in 09, and that show was
        wild as hell. What was the inspiration behind <em>Spred Luv</em>? I feel
        like at that point, you had established yourself in the city's live
        scene.<br /><br />
        B: Yeah, I think things overall here had increased. I had been on tour
        twice in 2009. The 1816 Calumet St. house was going on. I had more
        hardware at this point now too. I just plugged my MPC into a tape
        machine in the calumet house and started rapping harder. Tonally
        <em>Spred Luv</em> is my favorite. I was using these high-quality
        cassettes, which, combined with the tape machine, gave it this crazy
        sound. MR: Onto <em>True Spirit and Not Giving a Fuck</em>, which you're
        reissuing soon. What about that record made you want to revisit it
        now?<br /><br />
        B: I always liked the production work on <em>True Spirit</em>. It was
        the last set of beats I made on that MPC before it broke. I have better
        gear now, so I think I can remaster it for the reissue. I never put it
        on wax either, so I think that would be dope.<br /><br />
        MR: How do you remaster that record? Did that MPC breaking lead to
        <em>GEN</em>?<br /><br />
        B: <em>True Spirit</em> was all digital files, and I just found the
        original hard drive it was backed up on. So, I think I can salvage any
        weird issues with software. Yeah, that MPC being out of commission led
        to a natural progression of just grabbing anything and flipping it into
        a weird song.<br /><br />
        FT: Can you tell us a bit about the 1816 Calumet house in Houston? What
        was it?<br /><br />

        B: I met these older kids in high school. Some of them even before that.
        I linked back up with them around 2008. They had a house on Hawthorne
        and Taft.<br /><br />
        FT: I remember playing shows with you at the house and hanging out there
        often. Did it become your studio and practice space during
        <em>Spred Luv</em> and <em>True Spirit</em>?<br /><br />
        B: I think after a hurricane, they regrouped on Calumet. Yeah, I was
        there a lot and also at Dennis Street sometimes too.<br /><br />
        FT: <em>True Spirit</em> will always be a unique album to me. I opened
        up for you on my first tour in 2011 when it came out. Does saxophone
        show up for the first time in your music on <em>GEN</em>?<br /><br />
        B: Yeah, the saxophone came in the mix on <em>GEN</em>. Can you believe
        that was ten years ago?!<br /><br />
        FT: I know!<br /><br />
        B: I think some of the songs sounded too sparse without it. I really
        forgot I still had it.<br /><br />
        FT: What was going on in your life while making
        <em>GEN</em>?<br /><br />
        B: I was nonstop working in a warehouse. I had a kid. I bought a house.
        I was still going on tour. They brought me out to Europe. The broader
        "noise-rap" scene was emerging. I think more prominent websites and
        blogs were paying attention.<br /><br />
        MR: That was a very fruitful time, with Death Grips, early Travis Scott,
        etc.<br /><br />
        FT: Your major life changes match the progression happening in your
        music. On our 2011 tour, I remember we played Pop Montreal and met up
        with Death Grips in their hotel room via Matt Sonzala. How did the
        popularity of “noise-rap” in the early 2010s affect your goals as an
        artist?<br /><br />
        B: I think the change was good. Everything is constantly moving. I
        realize time is probably the strongest currency. Regarding the noise-rap
        stuff, I looked behind the curtain and saw what it really is, so I don't
        think it changed my true mindset or artistry. It freed me up to get more
        experimental. I had negative feelings, but it's ok.<br /><br />
        FT: Was the European tour your first time playing outside of the
        USA/Canada? Where did you go? How was it?<br /><br />
        B: Yeah, I mean, it was my first time leaving North America just in
        general as a human traveler. Kinda crazy. I was really nervous. I was
        mostly in France. I played in Amsterdam. It was a long tour. It ended in
        Canada. The Canada shows are pretty blurry to me. I felt different when
        I got home.<br /><br />
        FT: Why did you recently change this album title almost a decade after
        its release?<br /><br />
        FT: Starting with <em>Marathon Man</em> onwards, we see a defined style
        in your artwork. Your sound at that point (and now) feels like a mesh of
        True Spirit and GEN. It feels like the next evolution of that sound. A
        free jazz influence seems to enter your music at this time too. Did you
        intend to make your artwork and sound more cohesive? What can you say
        about this stretch of releases? What was happening in your life then?
        <em>Marathon Man (Fuck the False)</em>, <em>Imagine Yourself</em>, and
        <em>Remains</em>.<br /><br />

        B: That was the original title I thought up when I found the image. And,
        man, I found a database online of the loudest songs ever recorded.
        “Marathon Man” was on the list. The person put a note like, "this song
        achieved 0, which should be technically impossible".
        <em
          >[Editor's Note: RMS levels for loud music typically range between -7
          dBFS and -12 dBFS.]</em
        ><br /><br />
        B: Marathon Man was more like a compilation of tracks that didn't fit on
        previous records. I wanted to do better merch, so I focused on art that
        was really direct.
        <em>Imagine Yourself in a Free and Natural World</em> kinda started as a
        joke or thought exercise for my friends when we were driving the work
        trucks. We would just talk about books and space out. It was a cold
        winter that year. I had time and brought out the bass and saxophone from
        the closet and just started improvising. I didn't plan on dropping it.
        It was sitting on a cassette tape unfinished for months. The live shows
        around this time were getting more heavy. The earlier shows from
        2009-2011 were crazy and fun, but the shows at this time were more
        intense and reflective.<br /><br />
        I was super cool with how <em>Imagine Yourself</em> came out, so I took
        a creative break from recording. I was never totally satisfied with
        anything I recorded until <em>Imagine Yourself</em>. Remains took a long
        time. I prefer to work slow. So the time in between really reminded me
        of the time between earlier projects. I was still doing shows and going
        on weird tours, but something changed after
        <em>Imagine Yourself</em> and before <em>Remains</em>. I just remember
        being in other cities and assuming it's going to be another empty noise
        show, smoking a cigarette. Walk back into the club, and it's totally
        packed. Not everywhere was like that, but that was sometimes
        happening.<br /><br />
        MR: Where were you working, for context?<br /><br />
        B: I was driving box trucks, not 18-wheelers.<br /><br />
        MR: What was the effect of playing more and more packed shows?
        Creatively, but also personally. Did you find it harder to perform for
        bigger audiences? Notably, as you said, if those performances could be
        more intense around that time.<br /><br />
        B: It was cool, but it was also weird. Here's a specific example. I
        played in Providence, RI, with four bands on a Sunday night. There might
        have been five people in the room besides the other bands. I played in
        Richmond, VA, a day or two later. The place was too packed to even rage
        or mosh. It didn't even feel safe. It gets strange to witness that kind
        of dynamic.<br /><br />
        FT: Your shows are now drawing bigger audiences; you've settled on a
        visual aesthetic for your album art/merch. Overall you're in a new
        groove. What gear are you using at this time, and where are you
        recording? Is anyone helping you with the record? Other musicians,
        engineers?<br /><br />
        B: I was using a lot of the same gear. Even the same computer I recorded
        <em>True Spirit</em> with. I was playing the bass into a tape deck and
        manipulating it. I was recording riffs I had stashed from when I was a
        teenager. My friend Sam would send me beats, and I would destroy them
        and re-sample them back into the live instrumental tracks. I spent a
        long time on it.<br /><br />
        FT: Who is Sam?<br /><br />
        B: I met Sam in 2nd grade at church. He's super chill. He makes beats,
        but he's kind of chill about it. His older brother was in this group
        called Hafaza.<br /><br />

        FT: What do you think about the overall push to use more live
        instrumentation in your music over the past five years? Hearing you play
        bass on Remains felt really right to me. It reminded me of your punk
        rock side. To me, your music incorporates elements of free jazz too.<br /><br />
        B: Thanks, man. I think I read an old UGK interview, and Pimp C said his
        father told him, “if he added some music into that hip-hop stuff, he
        might have something.” So that stuck with me. Plus, to just challenge
        myself and start differentiating my style more and more.<br /><br />
        FT: I was thinking about that quote recently!<br /><br />
        B: Hell yeah.<br /><br />
        B: The first ten years were an uphill battle until right before
        Remains.<br /><br />
        MR: Do you mean personally, or that Remains was the album you always
        wanted to make?<br /><br />
        B: No, I just meant like hard work! Like starting from zero and pushing
        uphill.<br /><br />
        FT: You could look at that moment as the second coming of blackie. B L A
        C K I E 2.0.<br /><br />
        B: Sometimes, my name wasn’t even on the flyer for the show. And ten
        years later, now I’m headlining. Younger bands are dapping you up before
        they go on. It’s all good! Really in my head, I just want to drop
        another beat. The show could be really cool or really trash. It’s all
        good. I just like turning the amplifiers all the way up.<br /><br />

        FT: What led to Face the Darkness I and II? What was going on in your
        life after Remains?<br /><br />
        B: I had been recording pretty heavily and still upgrading equipment. I
        just kept picking up the guitar every day and forming more ideas. I
        wanted to find a middle ground between Imagine Yourself and Remains.
        Imagine Yourself is super minimal. Remains is chaotic. FTD 1 and 2 were
        recorded at the same time from 2017-2018. It was a giant thing. I spent
        2019 micing it all. The world went berserk last year, so I was like
        fuck, it makes sense to put this out. Imagine Yourself was written on
        the bass guitar. Remains was mostly written with the piano. FTD was
        written on an acoustic guitar.<br /><br />
        FT: When I first saw you at an art show in Robert Hodge’s downtown
        warehouse in 2007, I was blown away. Every time I’ve seen you perform
        since has been a cathartic and emotional experience in the audience. How
        did you develop your live show? How has your live show changed over the
        years?<br /><br />
        B: Those early shows were gnarly. I was still learning how to perform. I
        felt trapped inside as a child. Coming out of abuse, it is cool to
        finally scream in a microphone as an outlet. Doing it too much is
        draining and possibly not healthy. I had to learn how to tap into the
        emotional stream but still stay cool in my skin.<br /><br />
        FT: After being blown away by your shows, I got your Wilderness of North
        America album and was really struck by the lyrics, “Knives” in
        particular. I cried while listening to it as I read along. What inspires
        your lyrics? What themes do you like to address in your songs?<br /><br />
        B: I make all the beats before I start writing. Everything will be done
        except the vocals. Then I just sit there and let it all loop and loop
        until my brain starts catching all the counter-rhythms and
        half-melodies. I just fit words into what I feel musically should
        happen.<br /><br />
        FT: Lyrically, what are you going for on both Face the Darkness
        albums?<br /><br />
        B: I was thinking about dark shit from childhood.<br /><br />
        FT: It’s great that you often release lyric sheets so people can fully
        understand you. Your music is deeper than just something you mosh to and
        is best experienced with full attention. “Tired of Being Hunted” is my
        favorite on FTD II. You said the world went berserk last year. Were you
        trying to address more socio-political issues on these new albums? Has
        that always been a part of your music?<br /><br />

        B: Thanks, man. Yeah, it always is present, but I try to take the
        political into the personal and then express my personal experiences. I
        had finished everything around February 2019.<br /><br />
        FT: Who are some of your favorite rappers or groups? Which of them
        inspired your music?<br /><br />
        B: Definitely Triple Six and UGK. Project Pat. But honestly, Schoolly D
        and Ice T.<br /><br />
        FT: I love Schoolly D; that makes a lot of sense, even his production.
        Can you talk about any of those artists and tell me what draws you to
        their music?<br /><br />
        B: Yeah, the hand-drawn cover art. Triple Six had the punchiest kick
        drum on the early stuff. It was very rock n roll. UGK had the hi-hats.
        Schoolly D and Triple Six had the murky reverb coating everything. I
        like that ill type of delivery Schoolly, Ice-T, and Pimp C used. Where
        they just sound too cool to even shoot you, but they still might shoot
        you.<br /><br />

        FT: I’ll never forget on Wilderness of North America on the song “That’s
        Right,” you say, “give me, give me pop-rap/throwback backpack tracks/I
        throw those motherfuckers back.”<br /><br />
        B: Man, I heard bone thugs “Foe Tha Love of Money” and realized I had
        spit part of Eazy-E’s verse on an old track.<br /><br />
        FT: You subconsciously rapped part of Eazy- E’s verse on an old song?<br /><br />
        B: Absolutely, super homage<br /><br />
