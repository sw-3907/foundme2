              I grew up in a suburb of the city named Spring where I actually just moved back to a few weeks ago to complete my last semester of college. Besides school, I work at a restaurant in the city and have been there for almost three years. I think having such a healthy workplace environment and supportive management has truly helped me focus a lot more on art because that was always a hurdle in the past. I know in interviews artists always say when asked about the genesis of their practice, “Well I’ve always been a creative person, even as a kid.” And yeah, that’s true but I didn’t get to fully embrace my creativity until I moved out. I grew up in
              a super academic, Christian household and repressed a lot of creative energy and didn’t fully come out of my shell until after high school. However, I always wrote poems and fiction growing up because those were things I could easily tuck away from strict parents, and I drew a lot in church to keep myself awake. I think more than anything I liked writing. I struggled
              a lot staying focused on tasks in school, but writing was something that came easily to me and has been a part of myself I’ve been trying to nurture more. Even when it comes down to making cyanotypes, I sometimes jot down a few random sentences that may or may not end up
              being whole poems to help provide any visuals for a story I’d like to portray on a piece.</p>

            I found cyanotypes back in 2018 or 2019. I was doing a lot more graphic design and a little photography around this time for school and just making fliers for shows every now and then but was struggling a lot creatively and (full transparency) was also super depressed. I was researching branches of photography and alternative photographic processes and came across the cyanotype, or blue-print, as some know them as. I was super into Man Ray at the time and knew he coined “rayographs” which I was super fascinated by. I picked up a kid- friendly cyanotype kit where you just put plants and other found objects on the blue paper,
            set it out in the sun, rinse it, and let it dry. They turned out horribly, but immediately something inside me was born, as cheesy as that sounds. To this day, I don’t use a UV lamp or anything because that kid-like excitement of going out in the sun and printing something feels so playful and much less technical. Waking up on a sunny day is so special knowing it could be a day filled with making art, running in and outside
            like a kid on summer break with blue stained popsicle fingers. Instead for me, my fingers are stained blue by photoactive chemicals I’m not entirely sure are nontoxic.
            Another thing I love about the medium is that it’s so mutable and diverse. As a person that can barely stay focused on one thing for too long, this medium is something I can carry with me if I’m feeling like printing on shirts or totes, or if I’m into printing on ceramics, or good ol’ fashion paper. I was able to make an entire bed installation and it was still technically under my “practice” of cyanotypes. It’s such a simple process to learn but allows me to experiment with so many other creative endeavors and make my mark in the beautiful Prussian blue.

          <p class="p-24 max-w-3xl text-lg bg-slate-100">B. Anele [IG: @surprisinghealthbenefits] approached me back in 2020 about them opening a gallery and wanting me to showcase art in a group show. There was no theme or anything but over the months I did a lot of reading, writing, experimenting, and printmaking to help develop what I guess could now be described as my “style” and thus the show
            was born. It became a solo exhibition not too long before the show itself and I took this as a sign to really try and hone my craft
            and creative process. I wanted the first time I would show art in a solo show to be extremely personal, not necessarily too complex but still open to interpretation. B. is a brilliant soul and wonderful friend and they walked me through everything I needed to know and had so much patience with me as we navigated the process of “Is Heaven a Mountain?”. I haven’t shown anywhere else yet. I have a few things that should be coming up soon, but nothing set
            yet. Honestly just super blessed that after the show, people started reaching out to me. I
            was worried I had peaked or something else wouldn’t come along for a while but I’m keeping myself busy and I take a moment every day to give gratitude for the direction my life is going.

            There aren’t many other specifically cyanotype artists around for me to turn to for inspiration but I kind of prefer it that way. John Dugdale
            was one I found out about awhile back, and he makes me want to focus more on portraits and simplistic still life prints. His work grounds me in realizing not every print has to be super complex.
            I’m mostly inspired by nature and believe it’s not just a muse but my biggest collaborator. I mean, I use the sun to make all my prints. There’s a lot to learn about those we share the planet with, human and nonhuman, and I am gracious to be given a space and platform to bring topics like this to light, even if sometimes it feels overwhelming. I remember writing in an artist statement, “What can an ant teach us about the importance of breaking bread with each other? How can my communication with a horse heal my trauma? What can mycelium teach us about community?” I think there’s something poetic in forming allegories and fables from science and other random bits of life. During quarantine as well I had a few pen pals share bits and pieces of things that have been a part of their everyday and what’s been inspiring them, I look to those letters often for an inspirational kick, not even solely for artistic purposes but just as a moment to express gratitude for kinship and life.

            To list a few specific examples, Ivan McClellan is currently one of my favorite photographers and journalists. He has an entire project centered around shifting the narrative of the image of the “American Cowboy” to be all inclusive and I find his work mesmerizing and highly influential. His work I believe was first sparked by attending the Bill Pickett Rodeo, another phenomenon that has served as a recent inspiration of mine. Some media I often turn to includes Cane River, a film that was
            lost until recently that covers topics of class and colorism in a Louisiana community. While educational, the film fits into the “Romeo and Juliet” archetypal romance but with beautiful imagery, black joy/love, and horses. I also enjoyed the documentaries by Les Blank: The Blues Accordin’ to Lightnin’ Hopkins (1969), A Well Spent Life (1971), and The Maestro Rides Again (2005). Each I could probably rant on about for hours at a time, but I’ll just leave y’all with the recommendations.

            Lastly, I recently watched a documentary on Criterion called <em>Black Rodeo</em>, very fitting watch since the aforementioned Bill Picket Rodeo was televised for the first time this year on Juneteenth. The beauty of this documentary permeates my everyday thoughts and I often mediate on its imagery.

            I’ve really been wanting to get into ceramics, it’s such an expensive leap to make but once
            I learned I can print on clay my whole world shifted. I began to imagine a bathroom shower adorned with cyanotype tiles that tell a story, or several different clay sculptures turning a flat cyanotype into physical objects, able to be held and felt. It’s also so hands-on and a large part of cyanotype making involves me sitting in front of a screen. I want to dive into more practices that allow me to do more things with my hands and produce more three-dimensional results. I’m also trying to learn about reupholstery, maybe eventually carpentry in regard to furniture making. After the bed installation I got inspired to get into redoing furniture. I want to make my friends’ custom chairs, stools, and couches haha.

            I’ve always loved horses as a kid, grew up watching westerns with my grandma, and of course went to the rodeo every year but never actually pursued horseback riding because obviously that’s a big financial decision I didn’t want to burden my parents with. I started regularly riding horses this year thanks to that stimulus check haha and kept it up whenever
            I could budget it in. I started researching
            the history behind Black cowboys as I have also been learning a lot about farming as an African American and all the history there. Then in a Baader–Meinhof fashion, Black cowboys appeared everywhere. I thrifted
            a book filled with photographs of modern- day Black cowboys and cowgirls. I came across photographers, podcast episodes, documentaries, and films showcasing this lesser known, yet imperative part of American history and it quickly became something I not only immersed myself in but wanted to live out myself. Really put future goals and aspirations into perspective for me as well. I sought out riding horses at first for a physical hobby,
            something to allow myself to get outdoors, and in that I found pure happiness. A happiness I never thought would be possible to feel. It’s definitely become more prominent in my art the more I ride and learn about the animals.

            Historical context aside, I do think there’s something beautiful to be shared with the relationship between rider and horse, and horses alone are the most ethereal animal
            to me. I recently began learning about wild horses and burros and the fight to protect their population from unfair treatment. I think the western imagery I’ve been experimenting with more is mostly to reimagine the original lore that comes with the obsession with western culture painted through a mostly white lens. I’ve gotten the opportunity to spend time in west Texas and experience the life I could possibly see for myself, while also having the space to criticize and analyze the way art out there strongly serves white men. But I’ve mostly allowed myself to feel idealistic for once. Dream of the life I see not just for myself, but many others like me. To be able to share land, experience the beauty of nature alongside nature itself, share experiences and stories rather than currencies and simply riding horseback into a sunset if that’s what you’re into.
