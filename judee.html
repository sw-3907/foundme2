        INT. HOLIDAY INN HOTEL ROOM - MORNING <br><br>
        JUDEE is in the middle of her interview with Rolling Stone. She’s
        sitting with her back to the window and her legs propped up on the
        bed, the hot Phoenix sun piercing through the blinds behind her. The
        INTERVIEWER sits across from her, his tape recorder set on the desk
        beside him. Judee can’t decide whether to cross her legs or not.
        There’s an open bible sitting on her lap.          
      </p>

         JUDEE <br><br>
        My habit was running into a hundred and fifty dollars a
        day, so I turned to forging checks to make the extra
        dough. One night I overdosed and my heart stopped
        beating. I was technically dead for three minutes.
        The next thing I knew, these people were putting milk
        in my veins, and they were slapping me around until
        I came to. I remember waking up, but I had amnesia
        and I couldn’t even remember the words for “ceiling”
        or “wall”. All I could say was, “What happened?” I
        lived...only to be arrested for the forged checks.

          INT. SYBIL BRAND INSTITUTE - EVENING <br><br>
          FLASH BACK: Judee waits in a long line of fellow inmates, all waiting
          to make their phone call. Everyone is in bad shape, but Judee looks
          especially down and out. <br><br>
          It’s finally Judee’s turn. Her finger is stiff and darting with each
          button press, but when she puts the phone to her ear, she barely has
          the strength to hold it with both hands. She leans against the booth
          for support. The phone rings.
        </p>

        <p class="dialogue-style">
          JUDEE <br><br>
          Hey Dennis, It’s Judee. Listen, I need— <br><br>
          (Judee realizes it’s a young girl’s voice on the phone) <br><br>
          —Oh, hey Donna!...It’s your aunt Judee. Do you remember
          your aunt Judee?...Well I’m doing alright. Listen
          sweetie, can you put your dad on the phone?
          I really need to talk to him...Well where is he?...What
          do you mean he’s not here anymore?...Oh sweetie, you
          really shouldn’t say things like that, now can you put
          your dad on the phone, I really need to- <br><br>
          (brief static and then an older woman’s voice
            suddenly comes to the phone)
        </p>

        <p class="non-dialogue-style">
          DOLLY IN on Judee. Her face goes from confusion to deep sadness.

          I hadn’t seen my brother in three years. I didn’t want
          him to see me as a junkie, you know? I found out that
          he’d died of a liver infection. Later on I found out he
          died the same day I had ODed. I still think about him.
          He was the only family I had left.

          INT. HOLIDAY INN HOTEL ROOM - MORNING <br> <br>
          The interviewer is stunned. The air has been sucked out of the room
          with Judee’s last admission. Judee begins sucking on her teeth and
          tapping her fingers on the closed Bible sitting in her lap.
        </p>

        <p class="dialogue-style">
          JUDEE <br>
          I was just beyond desperation in jail. I called
          everybody I knew, but no one would help bail me out
          because they all knew better. I can’t tell you how
          terrified I was at the prospect of being without heroin.
          Not only to not be fixing, but just to be alive with
          the air touching my skin. It was the most fear I’d
          ever felt. It was worse, I imagine, than hell could
          be. I spent three nights in the county jail, puking my
          guts out. Pretty soon, I was over the physical part of
          kicking, but I still had the all-consuming misery of
          being alive without having a drug.

          INT. JAIL CELL - EVENING <br> <br>
          FLASHBACK: Judee is slumped over on her cot with her head between
          her knees. She suddenly lifts her head up for air. Judee exhales and
          begins to fix her posture.

        JUDEE (V.O) <br> 
        In jail, I had this recurrent fantasy about becoming
        a songwriter. I had such a hunger with this drug
        addiction that I thought maybe I could use that hunger
        to push me forward, you know? Like If I could keep my
        hungry monsters in line — keep them on a diet of bread
        and water — then maybe I could use them to pull my
        chariot forward and become a great songwriter.

          MONTAGE: Judee closes her eyes. CLOSE UP of Judee’s hands lifting
          from her knees, her wrists arching forward. She begins to pantomime
          playing piano. She’s back in reform school playing Ray Charles
          instead of the gospel hymns she was supposed to play. Judee is
          tickled by this. CUT TO Judee limping over to the prison bars. She
          looks out through the bars as if she’s looking out to an audience.
          She can hear the crowd, and so can we. CUE crowd noise. CUT TO Judee
          turning with her back to the prison bars. She lifts her arms up and
          begins conducting. She quietly hums a melody so as not to wake her
          cell mates, but in her head she can hear the full arrangement. CUE
          “Abracadabra” Overture. <br> <br>

          JUDEE <br>
          Somehow, I got off on probation. Some people I knew –
          they were sort of middle-aged hippies who’d helped me
          out when I was an acid-head – they got me this lawyer,
          David, who was very handsome and suave and quite a
          romantic figure in the courtroom, and I really liked him
          a lot... <br> <br>
          (Judee’s mind wanders for a second) <br> <br>
          Anyway, the judge put me on Naline probation for two
          years – that’s that surprise anti-opiate testing to
          make sure you’re staying off dope. I got to be the star
          of the program – can you believe it?? I was the only
          one in it who wasn’t nodding out!
        </p>

        <p class="non-dialogue-style">
          Judee pumps her fists in the air like a boxer raising their gloves in
          victory, wearing a big cheesing grin on her face. The interviewer lets
          out a big laugh. A weight has been lifted.

        <p class="dialogue-style">
          JUDEE <br>
          So once I got out, I got back into playing bass at the
          club. It was about then I decided I’d better channel
          myself towards songwriting - using those hungry
          monsters, y’know. But I also had a few romances here
          and there. <br> <br>
              (Judee gives a bashful grin) <br> <br>
          I had this one romance with another bass player. I
          have this attraction to bass players because I’ve
          always liked a good bass line, y’know...
        </p>

          CUT TO: <br> <br>
          INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT <br> <br>
          FLASHBACK: Judee has just finished another gig playing bass and makes
          her way off stage towards the bar. CUT TO the next group taking the
          stage. The BASS PLAYER is in shadow, a tall but gentle presense. 
          He kicks off the first song with a tasteful bass line. Judee takes
          notice. The band joins in as the lights come up. The Bass Player,
          pleased with the groove he has going, begins to scan the crowd when
          he notices a pair of eyes on him. CUT TO Judee making eye contact
          with him and smiling. He smiles back.

          He was a Scorpio, and we lived together for a while.
          And one day I painted this bird on his wall...
        </p>


        <p class="non-dialogue-style">
          CUT TO: <br> <br>
          INT. BASS PLAYER’S BEDROOM - DAY <br> <br>
          FLASHBACK: WIDE SHOT, camera is placed just outside of the door
          frame. Judee is sitting on the bed, legs tucked under her knees,
          playing guitar. On the wall is a beautiful mural of a large mythical
          bird that nearly takes up the whole wall (looks like a phoenix). The
          mural looks freshly painted and you can see small paint marks on
          Judee’s arms and jeans. <br> <br>
          Judee is serenading the bird, playing an early version of “My Man
          on Love”. Bass Player enters the room, and slowly sits on the bed
          behind Judee.

          BASS PLAYER <br>
          What is this? <br> <br>
          (Judee chuckles, stops playing guitar) <br> <br>
          JUDEE <br>
          Don’t you know? It’s a magic wishing bird! <br> <br>
              (Bass Player lets out a big belly laugh) <br> <br>
                               BASS PLAYER <br>
          Hah! Well what’s it for? And what’s it doing on
          my wall? <br> <br>
                                  JUDEE <br>
          Well...if you rub it’s beak and make a wish, your
          wish will come true. <br><br>
                               BASS PLAYER <br>
          It’s that simple, huh? <br> <br>
                                  JUDEE <br>
          Well nothing is that simple. You can’t expect anyone
          or anything in this life to just show up and blow
          your mind. Even God. <br> <br>
          (Judee sets her guitar down, turns back around
          and faces Bass Player) <br> <br>
          Now let me tell you a little secret. If you really
          want something in this life, you gotta build it a
          bedroom, put out the milk and cookies every night,
          and hope that it comes. <br> <br>
          (Judee gestures to the mural) <br> <br>
          That’s what this is. Building the bedroom. Setting
          out the milk and cookies.
        </p>

        <p class="non-dialogue-style">
          Their eyes are locked. Judee’s eyelids lower. They kiss and begin to
          sink into bed, out of frame. FOCUS PULL on the mural.
        </p>

        <p class="dialogue-style">
          JUDEE(V.O) <br>
          That day made a lot of difference. I kind of sensed
          right then that romance wasn’t gonna be the answer
          for me...that maybe I had other things in store.
        </p>

        <p class="non-dialogue-style">
          CUT TO: Bass Player pulls up his jeans and makes his way towards the
          kitchen. Judee’s bare back is to the camera as she begins getting
          dressed as well.
        </p>

        <p class="dialogue-style">
          BASS PLAYER <br>
          All of this talk about milk and cookies has me
          craving something sweet. You want anything? <br> <br>
          (Judee looks over her shoulder) <br> <br>
          JUDEE <br>
          Yeah sure, I’ll be right there.
        </p>

        <p class="non-dialogue-style">
          Judee makes sure he’s out of sight before turning back around towards
          the bird. Judee takes a long beat, taking in the bird’s majesty. She
          places her hand on its beak and leans in, pressing her cheek against
          the bird’s chest. She whispers a secret. <br> <br>
          END SCENE.
