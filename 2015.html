      My friend Gabbi texted telling me where to park<br>
      my car where it wouldn’t be towed, behind Darkhorse,<br>
      saying we could skip formal pregame drinks<br>
      for chicken nuggets so we wouldn’t be day-drinking<br>
      on empty stomachs in the cold. I don’t even know the headliner,<br>
      she said, to which I spoke the chorus to “Blue Monday”<br>
      to which she nodded in recognition. I’d want to see that, Gabbi said,<br>
      and the first thing we did was hit the press lounge<br>
      for free drinks. I had spent the summer<br>
      turning google docs into invoices, flying on a plane<br>
      for the first time, speaking to peers I considered mentors<br>
      who asked me what it was like “living down there”<br>
      in tree-lined shadows of a press tent,<br>
      bartering yellow wristbands for entry into every party<br>
      that left me literally biting my tongue<br>
      so I could stay awake<br>
      on the train ride back to Humboldt Park.<br>
      I watched Sicko Mobb<br>
      perform in front of shelf clouds<br>
      thinking<br>
      “this is my life now” as I texted my availability<br>
      to hang.<br>
      Winter in Houston is an ice cube on a plate.<br>
      New Year’s Eve function at the house on Telephone—<br>
      I lived at home so I would show up to parties with Ciroc.<br>
      —Someone brought Ciroc—<br>
      The most action the living room saw<br>
      occurred when I pressed the spacebar on the <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT0GKX-Pfkg">“Bank Rolls” remix</a></u><br>
      to a group grinding on each other in front of another group who sat splayed<br>
      on the couch. The floor was sinking so water collected in one corner of the tub<br>
      which soon filled with urine<br>
      and the host told me the music was too loud, bending<br>
      my ear in violence I could not predict, and Gabbi<br>
      texted me at midnight, saying thanks for the invite and happy new year<br>
      but my momma doesn’t stay up and to be honest I don’t care to either but see you at work<br>
