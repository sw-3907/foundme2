      My friend Gabbi texted telling me where to park<br>
my car where it wouldn’t be towed, behind Darkhorse,<br>
saying we could skip formal pregame drinks<br>
for chicken nuggets so we wouldn’t be day-drinking<br>
on empty stomachs in the cold. I don’t even know the headliner,<br>
she said, to which I spoke the chorus to “Blue Monday”<br>
to which she nodded in recognition. I’d want to see that, Gabbi said,<br>
and the first thing we did was hit the press lounge<br>
for free drinks. I had spent the summer<br>
turning google docs into invoices, flying on a plane<br>
for the first time, speaking to peers I considered mentors<br>
who asked me what it was like “living down there”<br>
in tree-lined shadows of a press tent,<br>
bartering yellow wristbands for entry into every party<br>
that left me literally biting my tongue<br>
so it wouldn’t go numb so I could stay sober<br>
on the train ride back to Humboldt Park.<br>
I watched Sicko Mobb<br>
perform in front of shelf clouds<br>
thinking<br>
“this is my life now” as I texted my availability<br>
to hang.<br>
Winter in Houston is an ice cube on a plate.<br>
New Year’s Eve function at the house on Telephone—<br>
I lived at home so I would show up to parties with Ciroc.<br>
—Someone brought Ciroc—<br>
The most action the living room saw<br>
occurred when I pressed the spacebar on the “Bank Rolls” remix<br>
to a group grinding on each other in front of another group who sat<br>
on the couch. The floor was sinking so water collected in one corner of the tub<br>
which soon filled with urine<br>
and the host told me the music was too loud, bending<br>
my ear in violence I could not predict, and Gabbi<br>
texted me at midnight, saying thanks for the invite and happy new year<br>
but my momma doesn’t stay up and to be honest I don’t care to either but see you at work<br>
