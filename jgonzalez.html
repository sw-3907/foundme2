      I use traditional archives and the archives of my bloodline to
      explore conflicts of representation in a post-colonial landscape. By
      recalling the personal, the political, and the laborious histories
      impressed within the immigrant body, I reclaim the space within
      visual culture in which our communities are often absent from or
      misrepresented. My practice is tasked with repurposing traditional
      archival practices in favor of what has been passed down, body
      memory and a tradition of oral histories. These methods of
      conservation through the bloodline have an intergenerational
      authorship that traditional archives don't conserve or particularly
      activate.

    <em>
      This is important for me to explore in my work because a lot of my
      identity is not reflected in the traditional archive. Throughout my
      life, I have deconstructed and interrogated memory and recorded
      history to understand the way my community has navigated a landscape
      in which they're not in control of their own narrative or
      perception. I recontextualize the items and stories I work with
      through the lens of my own experiences to refer to past and current
      events, problems of visibility, memorialization, violence and
      immigration. My interest in combining materials from both of these
      sources comes from the desire to project and explore the intricacies
      that are produced and the space that is demanded when archives of
      the bloodline and traditional archives are put in conversation with
      each other.
